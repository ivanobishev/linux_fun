Introduction:
Linux is an open-source free-software operating system.
The majority of servers worldwide are hosted in Linux.

There are many distributions or distros like Ubuntu and Parrot.

In Linux the root directory is a slash.
In Linux everything is a file.
In the root directory we can find the main directories:
- bin: binaries or programmes.
- boot: files related to starting the computer.
- dev: files of devices.
- etc: configuration files.
- home: hosts our users.
- root: only the root user can access here.
- lib: libraries.
- var: variables, files updated frequently.
- proc: running processes.



Managing packages:
We have the APT (advanced package tool) interface to keep our system updated in
case of wanting to install an app:
$ apt
$ apt list
$ apt update
$ apt install nano
$ apt remove nano
